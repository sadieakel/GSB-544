## 1. Filter the data to include passengers only. Calculate the joint distribution (cross-tab) between a passenger's class and where they embarked. 

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd 
#hi there
# hello?
```

```{python}
data_dir = "https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/"
df_titanic = pd.read_csv(data_dir + "titanic.csv")
```

```{python}
pd.crosstab(df_titanic["class"], df_titanic["embarked"], normalize=True)
```

## 2. Using the joint distribution that calculated above, calculate the following:

* the conditional distribution of their class given where they embarked
* the conditional distribution of where they embarked given their class

Conditional distribution of class given where they embarked: 
```{python}
#hi
```

Use the conditional distributions that you calculate to answer the following quesitons:

* What proportion of 3rd class passengers embarked at Southampton?
* What proportion of Southampton passengers were in 3rd class?

```{python}

```

## 3. Make a visualization showing the distribution of a passenger's class, given where they embarked.
