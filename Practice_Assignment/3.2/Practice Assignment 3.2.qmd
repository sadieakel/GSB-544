## 0: Load the penguins dataset from the palmerpenguins library, as well as any other libraries you need.
```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sys import exit
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
```

```{python}
penguins=load_penguins()
```

## 1. Write a function that takes in information about a penguin, and returns one of the following definitions:

*   "Big Mouth Billy": Male penguins with bill length times bill depth greater than 800.
*   "Dainty Daisy": Female penguins with flipper length less than 5% of body mass.
*   "Average Adelie:" Any Adelie penguins that do not fall into either category.
*   "Other": Any penguins that do not fall into any of the categories.

```{python}
def penguin_type(x):
    if (x["sex"]=="male") & (x["bill_length_mm"] * x["bill_depth_mm"] > 800):
        return "Big Mouth Billy"
    elif (x["sex"] == "female") and (x["flipper_length_mm"] < (0.05 * x["body_mass_g"])):
        return "Dainty Daisy"
    elif x["species"] == "Adelie":
        return "Average Adelie"
    else:
        return "Other"
```


## 2: Use an iterable function to create a new variable called `category_name` that adds these labels.

```{python}
def add_category(penguins):
    penguins["category_name"] = penguins.apply(penguin_type, axis=1)
    return penguins
```

```{python}
add_category(penguins)
```


## 3: Run the following code to find the counts for each type.
```{python}
penguins.value_counts("category_name")
```
